The rider statue of Absalon at Højbro Plads in Copenhagen was raised by the municipality of Copenhagen in 1902 in memory of Bishop Absalon,
Copenhagen founder. The initiator was Bank Director Axel Heide of Privatbanken.
Absalon looks from his steep horse beyond the castle hall, and thus the center of power in Denmark.
He sits on his steep horse and stands strong and brave looking over the city he founded.
This portrayal is also not random: He appears as a true leader, perhaps stealing in spite of or contempt for them,
Now rule from Christiansborg, and defend the country he once fought for.
His head and torso, however, have turned almost ninety degrees to the right, and his gaze is facing the City Hall of Copenhagen in the distance.
